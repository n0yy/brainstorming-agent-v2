# PRD: E-Commerce Thrifting Platform (React Native + Appwrite)

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile-first e-commerce platform specialized for vintage (thrifting) product trading. It aims to bridge buyers and sellers of pre-owned items through a seamless digital marketplace.

### Scope

This platform will focus on core features required for thrifting, including product listings, user profiles, search functionality, and secure payment processing. It will not include third-party marketplace integration or logistics management.

### Objectives

* Enable secure and convenient buying/selling of vintage items via mobile devices.

* Provide an intuitive search and filtering system for vintage products.

* Ensure authenticated user management (buyers and sellers).

* Implement a reliable payment system integrated with Appwrite backend.

## Functional Requirements

* Core features: Product listings, user profiles, search/filter, authentication, payment integration, cart management.

* Admin dashboard for listing moderation (optional, phase 2).

* Real-time notifications for new listings or messages.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security**: Data encryption (Appwrite collections), secure authentication (OAuth 2.0 or email/password).

* **Performance**: Page load time < 3 seconds, API response time < 2 seconds.

* **Scalability**: Support 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

* **Compatibility**: React Native app must work on iOS and Android.

## Assumptions

* Third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) will be integrated via Appwrite APIs.

* Users have basic digital literacy to navigate mobile apps.

* Appwrite’s database and authentication services are stable and available 24/7.

## Dependencies

* React Native development environment.

* Appwrite backend with configured collections (products, users, orders).

* Payment gateway API keys (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

* Legal compliance for vintage product sales (e.g., customs regulations).

## Risks and Mitigations

* **Risk**: Appwrite API limitations (e.g., rate limiting).\
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching for frequent API calls and monitor usage.

* **Risk**: User data privacy concerns.\
  **Mitigation**: Adopt end-to-end encryption and GDPR-compliant data handling.

* **Risk**: App store rejection due to payment security.\
  **Mitigation**: Conduct security audits pre-launch.

## Timeline

* **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Requirements finalization, backend setup (Appwrite), UI/UX design.

* **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: React Native frontend development, payment integration.
